## Make a Simple Mosaic of Objects with OpenCV
### Architecture
0. Inspired by Instagram story filter
1. A program that adjusts photos through mouse clicks and saves the results.
2. User-friendly, akin to Photoshop for easy use.
3. Mosaic: Apply by dragging the mouse to select an area and pressing Enter.
4. Liquify: Apply the effect by dragging with the mouse; press Esc to save and exit.
5. Pressing Esc saves and exits.

### limitation
1. Improving the window design that appears when the program is executed.
2. Adding additional types of filters.
3. Implementing a feature to control the intensity of filters (e.g., determining the degree of blurring for a mosaic filter).
4. Enhancing user convenience with features like back and forward navigation.
5. Addressing the issue where the program does not function properly when the image file name contains Korean characters.
